// A number is divisible by 9 when the sum of its digits is 9 or a multiple of 9.

// A number is divisible by 4 when the last 2 digits are divisible by 4.
//    - 12: The last two digits are "12", which is divisible by 4, therefore 12 is divisible by 4.
//    - 156: The last two digits are "56", which is divisible by 4, therefore, 156 is divisible by 4.
//    - Note: This trick works because 100 is a multiple of 4, so any number ending in two zeros is divisible by 4.
